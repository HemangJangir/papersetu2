# PaperSetu Admin Guide

This guide explains how to manage your PaperSetu deployment, including user registration issues, database access, and admin interface improvements.

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. Password Validation Issue
**Problem**: When users entered a common password, they got an error, but when they entered a strong password, it showed "username/email already exists" even though they hadn't signed up yet.

**Solution**: 
- Improved the registration form validation order
- Added custom password strength validation
- Fixed the validation flow to show password errors before username/email errors
- Added common password detection

### 2. Admin Interface Visibility
**Problem**: Need to see conferences created by users in the deployed version.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced admin interface to show all conferences with detailed information
- Added user management interface
- Created management commands to list all data
- Added quick access links and statistics

### 3. Admin UI Styling
**Problem**: Admin interface was black and white and hard to read.

**Solution**:
- Completely redesigned admin interface with modern colors
- Added better contrast and readability
- Improved table styling and form fields
- Added status indicators and action buttons

## 🚀 How to Access Your Database

### Method 1: Admin Interface (Recommended)
1. Go to your deployed site: `https://your-domain.com/admin/`
2. Login with your admin credentials
3. Navigate to:
   - **Users**: `/admin/accounts/user/` - See all registered users
   - **Conferences**: `/admin/conference/conference/` - See all conferences
   - **Papers**: `/admin/conference/paper/` - See all papers

### Method 2: Management Commands
Run these commands on your server:

```bash
# List all conferences with details
python manage.py list_all_conferences

# List all users with details
python manage.py list_all_users

# List only pending conferences
python manage.py list_all_conferences --pending

# List only recent users (last 7 days)
python manage.py list_all_users --recent 7

# List conferences by status
python manage.py list_all_conferences --status upcoming
```

### Method 3: Database Check Script
```bash
# Run the database check script
python check_database.py
```
